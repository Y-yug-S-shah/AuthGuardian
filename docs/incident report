1. Brute Force Attack Detection
Date: June 13, 2025
Analyst: Yug Shah
Incident Title: Multiple Failed Logins from Suspicious IP
Description:
While reviewing the AuthGuardian Splunk dashboard, I noticed a spike in failed login attempts. The logs showed multiple authentication failures from the IP address 192.168.1.123 targeting the user "sam_dev" over a 10-minute window at 16:00 hrs. This pattern matched known brute force attack behavior.
Investigation Steps:
Ran a Splunk query to extract all login attempts from this IP and user. The query revealed 15 failed attempts and no successful logins. I cross-referenced the IP with our internal whitelist and threat intelligence feedsâ€”no prior legitimate activity was found.
Action Taken:
I immediately blocked the IP in our firewall and reset the password for the "sam_dev" account as a precaution. I also updated the incident log and notified the account owner via email.
Conclusion:
The incident was contained before any unauthorized access occurred. The automated alert worked as intended, and manual review confirmed the threat.
Status: Resolved

2. False Positive Alert for Service Account
Date: June 14, 2025
Analyst: YugShah
Incident Title: Repeated Failed Logins for Service Account
Description:
An automated alert triggered for repeated failed logins by the service account "service_acc". The logs showed 8 failed attempts within an hour, at 12:00 hrs, all from an internal server IP.
Investigation Steps:
I checked the service account activity and found it was used for scheduled backups. The failures could be due to an outdated password in the backup script.
Action Taken:
This incident was forwarded to the further team for checking with whitelisting and updating credentials.
Conclusion:
This was likely a false positive due to an outdated password in the backup script. No security threat was identified.
Status: Forwarded for Further Review
